  abstract = {We introduce profile matching, a multivariate matching method for randomized experiments and observational studies that finds the largest possible self-weighted samples across multiple treatment groups that are balanced relative to a covariate profile. This covariate profile can represent a specific population or a target individual, facilitating the tasks of generalization and personalization of causal inferences. For generalization, because the profile often amounts to summary statistics for a target population, profile matching does not require accessing individual-level data, which may be unavailable for confidentiality reasons. For personalization, the profile can characterize a single patient. Profile matching achieves covariate balance by construction, but unlike existing approaches to matching, it does not require specifying a matching ratio, as this is implicitly optimized for the data. The method can also be used for the selection of units for study follow-up, and it readily applies to multi-valued treatments with many treatment categories. We evaluate the performance of profile matching in a simulation study of generalization of a randomized trial to a target population. We further illustrate this method in an exploratory observational study of the relationship between opioid use treatment and mental health outcomes. We analyze these relationships for three covariate profiles representing: (i) sexual minorities, (ii) the Appalachian United States, and (iii) a hypothetical vulnerable patient. We provide R code with step-by-step explanations to implement the methods in the paper in the Supplementary Materials.},

In a report in JAMA Network Open, Benjet et al used cardinality matching to examine the association of neighborhood exposure to violence during an armed conflict in Nepal with the incidence of major depressive disorder in younger children and older individuals. The authors found that children younger than 11 years at the start of the conflict who were exposed to violence during the conflict were significantly more likely to develop major depressive disorder than matched children in unexposed neighborhoods. In contrast, there was no association between exposure to violence and development of depression among individuals aged 11 years or older.}

  abstract = {The idea of covariate balance is at the core of causal inference. Inverse propensity weights play a central role because they are the unique set of weights that balance the covariate distributions of different treatment groups. We discuss two broad approaches to estimating these weights: the more traditional one, which fits a propensity score model and then uses the reciprocal of the estimated propensity score to construct weights, and the balancing approach, which estimates the inverse propensity weights essentially by the method of moments, finding weights that achieve balance in the sample. We review ideas from the causal inference, sample surveys, and semiparametric estimation literatures, with particular attention to the role of balance as a sufficient condition for robust inference. We focus on the inverse propensity weighting and augmented inverse propensity weighting estimators for the average treatment effect given strong ignorability and consider generalizations for a broader class of problems including policy evaluation and the estimation of individualized treatment effects.},

  abstract = {Propensity-score matching is frequently used to estimate the effect of treatments, exposures, and interventions when using observational data. An important issue when using propensity-score matching is how to estimate the standard error of the estimated treatment effect. Accurate variance estimation permits construction of confidence intervals that have the advertised coverage rates and tests of statistical significance that have the correct type I error rates. There is disagreement in the literature as to how standard errors should be estimated. The bootstrap is a commonly used resampling method that permits estimation of the sampling variability of estimated parameters. Bootstrap methods are rarely used in conjunction with propensity-score matching. We propose two different bootstrap methods for use when using propensity-score matching without replacementand examined their performance with a series of Monte Carlo simulations. The first method involved drawing bootstrap samples from the matched pairs in the propensity-score-matched sample. The second method involved drawing bootstrap samples from the original sample and estimating the propensity score separately in each bootstrap sample and creating a matched sample within each of these bootstrap samples. The former approach was found to result in estimates of the standard error that were closer to the empirical standard deviation of the sampling distribution of estimated effects. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {Propensity-score matching is frequently used in the medical literature to reduce or eliminate the effect of treatment selection bias when estimating the effect of treatments or exposures on outcomes using observational data. In propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects with similar propensity scores are formed. Recent systematic reviews of the use of propensity-score matching found that the large majority of researchers ignore the matched nature of the propensity-score matched sample when estimating the statistical significance of the treatment effect. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to examine the impact of ignoring the matched nature of the propensity-score matched sample on Type I error rates, coverage of confidence intervals, and variance estimation of the treatment effect. We examined estimating differences in means, relative risks, odds ratios, rate ratios from Poisson models, and hazard ratios from Cox regression models. We demonstrated that accounting for the matched nature of the propensity-score matched sample tended to result in type I error rates that were closer to the advertised level compared to when matching was not incorporated into the analyses. Similarly, accounting for the matched nature of the sample tended to result in confidence intervals with coverage rates that were closer to the nominal level, compared to when matching was not taken into account. Finally, accounting for the matched nature of the sample resulted in estimates of standard error that more closely reflected the sampling variability of the treatment effect compared to when matching was not taken into account.},

  abstract = {Propensity score methods are increasingly used in medical literature to estimate treatment effect using data from observational studies. Despite many papers on propensity score analysis, few have focused on the analysis of survival data. Even within the framework of the popular proportional hazard model, the choice among marginal, stratified or adjusted models remains unclear. A Monte Carlo simulation study was used to compare the performance of several survival models to estimate both marginal and conditional treatment effects. The impact of accounting or not for pairing when analysing propensity-score-matched survival data was assessed. In addition, the influence of unmeasured confounders was investigated. After matching on the propensity score, both marginal and conditional treatment effects could be reliably estimated. Ignoring the paired structure of the data led to an increased test size due to an overestimated variance of the treatment effect. Among the various survival models considered, stratified models systematically showed poorer performance. Omitting a covariate in the propensity score model led to a biased estimation of treatment effect, but replacement of the unmeasured confounder by a correlated one allowed a marked decrease in this bias. Our study showed that propensity scores applied to survival data can lead to unbiased estimation of both marginal and conditional treatment effect, when marginal and adjusted Cox models are used. In all cases, it is necessary to account for pairing when analysing propensity-score-matched data, using a robust estimator of the variance. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Propensity score (PS) matching is widely used for studying treatment effects in observational studies. This article proposes the method of matching weights (MWs) as an analog to one-to-one pair matching without replacement on the PS with a caliper. Compared with pair matching, the proposed method offers more efficient estimation, more accurate variance calculation, better balance, and simpler asymptotic analysis. A statistical test for the misspecification of the PS model is proposed for balance checking purposes. An augmented version of the MW estimator is developed that has the double robust property, that is, the estimator is consistent, if either the outcome model or the PS model is correct. The proposed method is studied in simulations and illustrated through a real data example.},

  abstract = {Background:Propensity score matching (PSM) is a statistical technique used to reduce bias in observational studies by controlling for measured confounders. Given its complexity and popularity, it is imperative that researchers comprehensively report their methodologies to ensure accurate interpretation and reproducibility.Purpose:This systematic review sought to define how often PSM has been used in recent orthopedic research and to describe how such studies reported their methods. Secondary aims included analyzing study reproducibility, bibliometric factors associated with reproducibility, and associations between methodology and the reporting of statistically significant results.Methods:PubMed and Embase databases were queried for studies containing ?propensity score? and ?match*? published in 20 orthopedic journals prior to 2020. All studies meeting inclusion criteria were used for trend analysis. Articles published between 2017 and 2019 were used for analysis of reporting quality and reproducibility.Results:In all, 261 studies were included for trend analysis, and 162 studies underwent full-text review. The proportion of orthopedic studies using PSM significantly increased over time. Seventy-one (41\%) articles did not provide justification for covariate selection. The majority of studies illustrated covariate balance through P values. We found that 19\% of the studies were fully reproducible. Most studies failed to report the use of replacement (67.3\%) or independent or paired statistical methods (34.0\%). Studies reporting standardized mean differences to illustrate covariate balance were less likely to report statistically significant results.Conclusion:Despite the increased use of PSM in orthopedic research, observational studies employing PSM have largely failed to adequately report their methodology.},

  abstract = {It is common to present multiple adjusted effect estimates from a single model in a single table. For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},
